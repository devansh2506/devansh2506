## 💫 About Me

I’m a second-year **B.Tech student at Delhi Technological University (DTU)**, actively building my skills in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I enjoy working at the intersection of theory and practice, turning ideas into functional, real-world systems.

I learn best by experimenting and building—constantly exploring new concepts, reading research, and implementing models from scratch. I’m particularly interested in understanding **why** things work, not just **how** to use them.

Driven by curiosity and a growth mindset, I’m always looking to deepen my understanding and improve through hands-on work.
